      <h2>Who are PENTAGON?</h2><br>
      <p>
        PENTAGON is a South Korean boy group formed by Cube Entertainment in 2016. The group originally consisted of ten members: Hui, Jinho, Hongseok, Kino, Shinwon, Yanan, Yuto, Wooseok, E'Dawn (now known as Dawn), and Changgu (stage name: Yeo One). PENTAGON is known for their versatility, unique concepts, and active involvement in songwriting, producing, and choreography.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their music spans a wide range of genres, including K-pop, R&B, ballads, and EDM, with hits like Shine, Daisy, and Naughty Boy. They gained significant attention for their catchy hooks and heartfelt lyrics, as well as their skillful blending of upbeat and introspective themes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group’s chemistry and dynamic personalities are showcased through their performances and content, earning them a dedicated global fanbase called Universe. Over the years, the lineup has undergone changes, with E'Dawn leaving the group in 2018 to pursue a solo career. Despite challenges, PENTAGON continues to thrive as a prominent act in the K-pop industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that being said, one question still remains. Are they any good???

        <p class="shift">The very first release comes in the form of a self titled debut. "PENTAGON" is a 7 track EP released on October 10, 2016 released under the Cube Entertainment LOEN Entertainment label. While the project's specific genre falls under K-Pop, it incorporates a multitude of other styles such as R&B, funk, electro, and hip-hop. </p>

        <p class="shift">This EP is a VERY strong debut showcasing the group’s versatility. The title track "Gorilla" establishes the general sound that the band holds, while b-sides like "Lukewarm" bring on more emotional tones and add depth to their versatility. Interestingly enough, there are a lot of experimental elements on this project, like the funk infused electronic production on "Gorilla", which isn't usually seen on a debut project. However, this gives listeners a good idea of what is to be expected from this band. An iconic sound mixed in with not-so traditional implementations to create a completely new style in itself. It's a solid introduction to their identity.</p><br>

    <div class="shift2">

        <p class="shift">Released the same year as their debut, we are given yet another mini EP. "Five Senses", packed with five tracks released just about two months later on December 7, 2016 is star studded with some very fun songs. </p>

        <p class="shift">This EP leans into funkier and upbeat sounds. With bright production and vocal performances, this almost feels like clean cuts from "PENTAGON". Each track delivers an uplifting, summery feeling accompanied by catchy hooks and flows. A big part of this project comes from the further implementation of swing, which will also become even more prevalent in the band's later works. This simple addition adds even more groove and makes their voices hit even harder. Speaking of which, I have to express how great Jinho and Hui sounded on the chorus of "Lose Yourself". Maybe the vibes were hitting a little too hard for me but they sounded like they had even more passion on this track than previously seen. Then the introduction of Kino, Yeo One, Yan An, and Shinwon on the post-chorus made everything feel whole. One  thing this EP definitely doesn't lack is amazingly executed vocal performances which are solid all the way through from beginning to end.</p>

        <p>
            <br><p>1. "Can You Feel It"</p><br>
            <p>The title track is an high energy opener, packed with a driving beat, energetic structure, and a VERY catchy hook. The playful interplay between the members' vocals and rap sections showcases their chemistry and charisma. It's an addictive track with an edgy, rebellious charm that commands attention.</p>
            
            <br><p>2. "Engine"</p><br>
            <p>This track is an anthem that keeps the energy levels soaring. The intense beat and ferociously delivered rap lines make it a standout track for its confidence. “Engine” demonstrates PENTAGON's ability to deliver a hard-hitting track without losing their melodic appeal.</p>
            
            <br><p>3. "Pretty Pretty"</p><br>
            <p>A contrast to the previous track with this more lighthearted and upbeat song that radiates charm. “Pretty Pretty” is filled with bright instrumentals and rather playful lyrics. It's a fun track that portrays PENTAGON's energy and liking for catchy melodies.</p>
            
            <br><p>4. "Lose Yourself"</p><br>
            <p>A mid-tempo track that holds a LOT of R&B influences, “Lose Yourself” is a smooth and captivating track that stands out on this project. The layered harmonies and lush production create a rather alluring soundscape adding to the depth of the project.</p>
            
            <br><p>5. "Stay Crazy"</p><br>
            <p>The closing track is a lively, danceable song that ends the EP on a very high note. Its rhythm and dynamic vocal delivery makes it the perfect finale, leaving listeners wanting more from this group.</p><br>
        </p>
            
        <p class="shift"> All in all, this is a pretty good sophomore project from the group. While the cohesion is slightly weaker than their debut EP, every song delivers the bright and synchronized sound that listeners of the group have come to love. With high energy standouts like "Can You Feel It" to party anthems like "Pretty Pretty" this project holds a very special place both in the band's discography as well as my own personal music vault. It may  not be the most groundbreaking project, but what can't be denied is that this is a very fun listen.</p>

    <div class="shift2">

        <p class="shift">PENTAGON's junior EP, "CEREMONY", released on June 12, 2017 feels like a stark contrast to both of the group's previous releases. While "PENTAGON" and "Five Senses" primarily utilized dazzling synths and quick tones, this project takes a bit of a slower approach in both sound selection and artistic performance. These alterations brings a new outlook on the group as they continue to grow and develop their own sound.</p>

        <p class="shift">The opening track, "Critical Beauty" entails that iconic PENTAGON sound with high energy vocals and a fast tempo instrumental however there is a notable difference with this track alone. It emphasizes and infuses both modern pop and retro swing, a great portrayal of the groups diversity and musical experimentation. The innovative decision making on this project prove to be rather prevalent throughout this project also, with songs like "Spectacular" and "Lucky" also implementing a blend of multiple genres to further develop their ideas.</p>

        <p>
            <br><p>1. "Critical Beauty"</p><br>
            <p>The title track is a retro-inspired bop that cleverly mixes doo-wop influences with modern hip-hop beats. Its playful vibe, witty lyrics, and dynamic performance highlight PENTAGON's ability to experiment with genres while staying true to their energetic identity. The brass section and funky rhythm make it irresistibly catchy and memorable.</p>
            
            <br><p>2. "Lucky"</p><br>
            <p>A refreshing, upbeat track with a bright and cheerful tone, "Lucky" feels like a summer anthem. The light instrumentation and breezy vocals create a carefree atmosphere, delivering an instant serotonin boost.</p>
            
            <br><p>3. "To Universe"</p><br>
            <p>This heartfelt ballad is a love letter to PENTAGON's fandom, Universe. The soft melodies and poignant lyrics express gratitude and hope, making it an emotional highlight of the album. The sincerity in the members' delivery shines through, creating a touching connection with listeners.</p>
            
            <br><p>4. "Nothing"</p><br>
            <p>"Nothing" is a laid-back track with a groovy rhythm and minimalistic production. Its understated charm comes from the smooth vocals and relaxed vibe, offering a nice contrast to the more upbeat songs on the EP.</p>
            
            <br><p>5. "Spectacular"</p><br>
            <p>Bursting with energy and optimism, "Spectacular" is an empowering track about finding beauty in life's challenges. Its anthemic chorus and vibrant instrumentation make it a standout moment that lifts the mood.</p>

            <br><p>6. "Thank you"</p><br>
            <p>A somber and orchestral track that focuses mainly on emotional factor over all other elements. This is quite easily the most touching track on the project that allows the uplifting vocals to shine against the sad instrumental.</p>
            
            <br><p>7. "Beautiful"</p><br>
            <p>This bonus track is a poignant ballad written and produced by BTOB's Ilhoon. The emotional lyrics and stripped-down arrangement allow PENTAGON's vocalists to shine, delivering a moving and heartfelt performance.</p><br>
        </p>

        <p class="shift">This is a very well rounded project and it follows a very cohesive pattern that ultimately makes it way easier for a listener to follow along even if they aren't too fond of the genre. It balances the two main tones, upbeat and mellow, very well, which isn't always the easiest thing to pull off when it comes to genres as fast paced as K-Pop.</p>
        
<br>
        <div class="flex2">
            <div class="overview-area"> <center><h2>Overview</h2></center><br>
                • <strong>Best Song:</strong> Critical Beauty <br>
                    <p class="indent">- Another amazing opening track from this group.</p><br>
                • <strong>Favorite Song:</strong> Thank You  <br>
                    <p class="indent">- This could go down as one of their most beautifully crafted tracks to date!!! The singing is simply amazing and the emotional tones speak VOLUMES!!!</p><br>
                • <strong>Least Favorite Song:</strong> Nothing<br>
                    <p class="indent">- A good track however it lacks the diversity of the other tracks on this project.</p><br>
                • <strong>Most Underrated Song:</strong> Lucky <br>
                    <p class="indent">- A great example of blending tones in this genre-bending song.</p><br>
            </div>
            </div>
        <br>
        <p>
        In the end, this is definitely an upgrade from both of the previous releases I feel. It showcases just how far the group is willing to go and what boundaries they are willing to stretch in order to create these amazing listening experiences. The project was, from start to end, a very cohesive and enjoyable listening experience, perfect for anyone looking to get into this genre as it defines quite possibly one of the most creative visions that the group has brought to fruition thus far.

        <p class="shift">On September 6, 2017, PENTAGON returned with another EP following the success of "CEREMONY". This 5 song project may be one of their shorter releases but it brings so much value to their discography as a whole. By this point, the group is focusing less on incorporating other elements and is instead working with the sound that they have already developed to create new experiences. What I enjoy most about this release is that it was actually mostly self produced and seemingly allowed the group the most amount of creative freedom thus far. This detail of freedom allowed for each member to get as personal as they wanted to which adds to the overall authenticity of this project.</p>

        <p class="shift">This is more than just a senior project from the group, in fact, it shows a level of growth in all musical aspects from production and cadence to songwriting and emotional appeal. The opening track "Like This" gives listeners a grand overview of what will be coming later in the EP with summer coded styling and catchy lyrics. The summer theme actually follows each track on this EP which adds to its cohesive nature. The self-produced nature of DEMO_01 adds a layer of authenticity to the album. It reflects the members' growth as artists, with tracks that feel both deeply personal and relatable. Along with the summer aspects, the EP also explores themes of love, dreams, and self-discovery, resonating with fans through its sincerity</p>

        <p>
            <br><p>1. "Like This"</p><br>
            The title track, "Like This," is an upbeat opening with heartfelt lyrics and an anthemic sound. The beat and emotionally jarring melodies really highlight PENTAGON's vocal and rap versatility. It's a rather motivational anthem about  chasing one's dreams which resonate deeply with listeners.</p>
            
            <br><p>2. "It's Over"</p><br>
            <p>A softer track that blends a wistful tone with smooth vocals. The use of the acoustic guitar and an otherwise minimalistic beat gives it a nostalgic feel, making it a standout for its emotional weight.</p>
            
            <br><p>3. "One More Night"</p><br>
            <p>This mid-tempo track resonates with a lucious vibe, held together by a groovy bassline and an understated instrumental. The lyrics delve into longing and self vulnerability, which is enhanced by a compelling vocal performance.</p>
            
            <br><p>4. "Get That Drink"</p><br>
            <p>This is a lighthearted song that leans into fun, youthful energy. Its catchy chorus and playful lyrics make it a refreshing addition to the album, which offers a moment of carefree enjoyment.</p>
            
            <br><p>5. "When I Was In Love"</p><br>
            <p>Closing the EP is another glorious ballad that puts emotion at the forefront. The soft instrumentation complements the heartfelt delivery from the group.</p><br>
        </p>

        <p class="shift">The album feels raw yet polished, balancing emotional introspection with playful energy, and it cemented PENTAGON's reputation as a self-sufficient group with a unique artistic vision. I must say that as of this point this is easily the group's best work. This feels like a true work of art that stems from true emotional experiences that each of the members have gone through. While it may not be the most defining EP for breaking into K-Pop it is most certainly a great listen that shows just how far the genre can be stretched and altered.</p>

Its mixture of heartfelt ballads and upbeat tracks creates a well-rounded project that appeals to a wide range of listeners. While not overly polished, the rawness of the EP is part of its charm, showcasing the group's growth and creative potential.

            <p>The title track "Violet" has blend of orchestral elements and modern pop beats. Its simple yet powerful arrangement is paired with very deep lyrics about a love that is both beautiful and fleeting. The emotional delivery from the members elevates the track, making it a standout centerpiece.</p>
            
            <br><p>2. "Runaway"</p><br>
            <p>A relatable song about escaping life's pressures, "Runaway" balances both vulnerability with determination. The mix of strong vocals, intense rap verses, and a catchy chorus creates a track that feels both introspective and empowering.</p>
            
            <br><p>3. "All Right"</p><br>
            <p>This track has a breezy, laid-back kind of vibe, delivering a sense of comforting optimism. The melody is mainly acoustic, being paired with some bright harmonies giving it a refreshing and lighthearted feel, and making it an easy listen.</p>
            
            <br><p>4. "Pretty Boys"</p><br>
            <p>"Pretty Boys" is a bold declaration of confidence. The rather playful lyrics and uptempo instrumental show off PENTAGON's fun and charismatic side, while the catchy hook leaves a lasting impression on the listener.</p>
            
            <br><p>5. "Stay With Me"</p><br>
            <p>A tender ballad that reaches into themes of longing and heartbreak. The rather simple production, featuring piano and soft strings, allows the members' vocal prowess to take center stage, creating an emotional moment on the album.</p>

        "Demo_02" is a fantastic release and a great sequel to "DEMO_01". In all honesty, had these two projects been put together, I feel like I would love it even more as a single work; however, them being separated gives off a similar effect to a stanza break in poetry, cultivating a deeper understanding of the concepts brought up in these works. While the initial project held more centered focused ideas, this one brought up more topics that the group had in mind to accompany the ones brought up before. A highly recommended listen for those who enjoy more introspective listens while still enjoying the style of K-Pop.

        <p class="shift">This was easily the career defining release for the group indeed. PENTAGON's 2018 release "Positive" thrusted the group into the lime-light, debuting at #6 on the Billboard World Albums chart and placing into the Top 10 on the Gaon Album Charts, essentially solidifying the group into the K-Pop scene. </p>

        <p class="shift">The glory and praise that this EP received did not go unwarranted as, by this point, it is one of PENTAGON's greatest works. Featuring six tracks, including the viral hit "Shine," this EP is a masterful balance of energy, emotional depth, and thought provoking storytelling. The album embodies its title very well, radiating positivity while exploring themes of self-discovery, ambition, and of course love. </p>

        <p>
            <br><p>1. "Off-Road"</p><br>
            <p>The EP opens with "Off-Road," a vigorous track with an adventurous and lively spirit. It creatively fuses both electronic elements and a rhythmic beat to set the tone for this project filled with confidence and classic experimentation. The song's anthemic quality makes it a VERY strong introduction.</p>
            
            <br><p>2. "Shine"</p><br>
            <p>The EP's centerpiece, "Shine," is an iconic blend of playful and uptempo piano loops, witty lyrics, and a high amount of danceability. The charm and self-deprecating theme about unrequited love resonates with many avid listeners, propelling Pentagon to new heights of recognition. The song's raw delivery and catchy melody makes it a timeless K-pop classic.</p>
            
            <br><p>3. "Think about you"</p><br>
            <p>A smooth, mid-tempo track that leans heavily into R&B influences, "Think About You" stands out the most in my opinion for its soulful harmonies and rather laid-back vibe. The emotional lyrics and crisp production create an atmosphere that contrasts beautifully with the album's more upbeat moments.</p>
            
            <br><p>4. "Do it for fun"</p><br>
            <p>This track radiates pure confidence and charisma, with playful lyrics and an infectious beat. It's a fun, high-energy anthem that encapsulates the group's youthful exuberance and knack for creating memorable hooks.</p>
            
            <br><p>5. "Nothing i can do"</p><br>
            <p>This slower, moodier track showcases a more reflective side of Pentagon. The introspective lyrics about the struggles of feeling helpless are complemented by a melancholic melody and smooth production, giving it a powerful emotional impact.</p>
            
            <br><p>6. "Let's go together"</p><br>
            <p>The closing track on this EP leaves off on a heartwarming note, this track is essentially a love letter to the fans and listeners. The uplifting lyrics and celebratory vibe make it a perfect finale, which reinforces the EP's overarching theme of positivity and unity.</p>

        <p class="shift">Released in September 2018 following the success of the critically acclaimed EP "Positive", PENTAGON returns with "THUMBS UP!"" A bold, high-energy project that blends their trademark charisma with even more experimental sounds. This six-track EP captures the group's ability to deliver infectious hooks, witty lyrics, and overall versatile performances, all while maintaining their creative authenticity. The release also stands out as a testament to Pentagon's resilience and artistic growth during a transitional period in their career with rising numbers and the  departure of their group member E'Dawn. </p>

        <p class="shift">This project acts as what seems to be a continuation of the previous work, which has been seen before in the group's discography. Everything from the production to the playful execution of the freedom filled lyrics fits the tones of positivity perfectly well.</p>

        <p>
            <br><p>1. "Naughty Boy"</p><br>
            <p>The title track is very playful, being driven by a reggae-inspired beat and an upbeat rhythm. Its lyrics, clever wordplay, and fun concepts reflect Pentagon's unique charm and style. The song's carefree vibe and catchy chorus gives listeners instant joy making it a highlight of the EP.</p>
            
            <br><p>2. "Just Do It Yo!!"</p><br>
            <p>A party anthem that leans into hip-hop influences with a punchy beat and powerful delivery. The energetic rap verses and dynamic production makes this yet another standout.</p>
            
            <br><p>3. "Skateboard"</p><br>
            <p>A laid-back and cohesively upbeat track, “Skateboard” captures that essence of youthful freedom that PENTAGON continues to push in their music. The smooth vocals and breezy instrumentation evoke a sense of nostalgia, making it a perfect song for relaxing.</p>
            
            <br><p>4. "When It Rains At Night"</p><br>
            <p>Slowing things down, this emotional ballad portrays PENTAGON's vocal depth and sensitivity. The lyrics about longing and heartache are paired with a melancholic melody, creating a soft and introspective moment on the album.</p>

        This is a very playful and fun EP that keeps Pentagon's charm alive. With catchy tracks like "Naughty Boy", the project continues to hold the theme from the previous release. While the project overall feels slightly less experimental when compared to Positive. It's still a VERY solid and cohesive work brought forward by the group.

This project houses six-tracks that each delve into themes of self-discovery, resilience, and individuality, blending diverse genres with Pentagon's signature charm. The EP marks yet another important step in their journey, as they continued to establish their unique identity while navigating the post-E'Dawn era.</p>

The song is full of charisma, capturing Pentagon's bold and dynamic vocal presence while maintaining an uplifting vibe.</p>
            
            <br><p>2. "Lost Paradise"</p><br>
            <p>A collaborative track by Kino, Yuto, and Wooseok, "Lost Paradise" is more of a moody, introspective song with a raw and emotional tone. The melody and reflective lyrics explore feelings of struggle and perseverance, showcasing a different, more vulnerable side of Pentagon.</p>
            
            <br><p>3. "Till..."</p><br>
            <p>This mid-tempo track leans into sentimental melodies and heartfelt lyrics about love and the feeling for longing for it. The smooth vocal harmonies and production sets it as an emotionally resonant piece that highlights the group's vocal depth.</p>
            
            <br><p>4. "Alien"</p><br>
            <p>With its experimental electronic production and deep lyrics, “Alien” stands out as one of the more 'avant-garde' tracks on the EP. The song delves into the feeling of alienation and individuality, blending futuristic soundscapes with emotional storytelling.</p>
            
            <br><p>5. "Spring Snow"</p><br>

        <p class="shift">Pentagon's SUMMER is a vibrant and refreshing project that encapsulates the carefree and joyful essence of the season. This five-track EP serves as a love letter to summer, blending upbeat melodies with heartfelt lyrics. It highlights the group's ability to craft songs that feel light and breezy while retaining emotional depth, showcasing their versatility as performers.</p>

        <p class="shift">While this project does follow suite to the theme that it has been set to, I feel as though this project, which houses only four tracks, lacks more depth and cohesiveness in terms of an actual project. This feels more like a single release rather than an EP especially considering the bonus track at the end of the 12 minute listen. While this may be true, what can also be stated is how each track does justice for what they each are and can carry themselves well individually.</p>

        <p>
            <p>"Humph!"</p>
            <p>The title track, which interestingly enough was produced by Giriboy, is a playful number that combines a catchy melody with an irresistibly fun concept. The lyrics depict a love-hate dynamic with a childlike twist, making it lighthearted and relatable.</p>
            
            <p>"Fantasystic"</p>
            <p>A high-energy track bursting with excitement and optimism, “Fantasystic” captures the magic of chasing dreams and just living in the moment. Its vibrant instrumentals and chorus create an exhilarating listening experience.</p>
            
            <p>"SUMMER!"</p>
            <p>This tropical pop-inspired track radiates feel-good vibes with its laid-back rhythm and beachy atmosphere. The smooth vocals and breezy production makes listeners feel as though they are on a sun-soaked paradise, making it a must-have summer anthem.</p>
            
            <p>"Round 2 - BONUS TRACK"</p>
            <p>Closing the EP on a humorous and self-referential note, “Round 2” is a fun, banter-filled track. The witty lyrics and casual delivery create a sense of camaraderie, giving fans an intimate look at Pentagon's close dynamic.</p>

        A summery release with lighter vibes. While tracks like "Humph!" show Pentagon's playful side, the EP lacks the depth and impact of their stronger efforts. Still, it's fun and suits its seasonal concept overall. I would definitely still recommend giving the songs a listen, even if they don't fit into a project based standpoint.

        As mentioned before, while this may not be their most impactful project by any means, I still think it is a fun listen and would recommend it to those who want a bit extra from the group after listening to their debut.

    <br><h2>Is Tessa's Music Taste Elite???</h2><br>

    <p class="shift">
        After diving deeply into PENTAGON's discography, I’ve discovered a newfound appreciation for this genre. As someone not particularly familiar with K-Pop, this group has been a gateway, drawing me in with their distinctive style and artistry. Exploring their extensive collection of EPs and albums allowed me to grasp not only the essence of their music but also the vision they project to their audience.
    </p>
    <p class="shift">
        PENTAGON’s ability to captivate listeners lies in their mastery of upbeat, flashy sounds paired with bold experimentation and genre-blending. Their cohesive integration of diverse musical elements creates a signature sound that stands out. What I admire most is their versatility: the effortless shift from fun, anthemic pop tracks to heartfelt ballads showcases a level of skill and artistry that is rare and deeply impressive. It would also seem as though a few of their works have left a bit of a lasting impression on me. While "Positive" is easily the group's best project in terms of both quality and numbers, I find myself returning back to a lot of their older works like their self titled EP and "CEREMONY" quite a lot. The same can be said for both "DEMO_01" and "Demo_02" as well. Something about the less polished and industry standard tracks really five the group a bit of a more natural feel. The sequence of EP's and albums also do well in showcasing the group's longevity and growth.
    </p>

        Would I credit Tessa with elite taste in music? MOST DEFINITELY! This journey through PENTAGON’s soundscape has been one of the most rewarding deep dives I’ve experienced in a long time. It has broadened my understanding of the genre more than any other artist or group ever has. I’m grateful to Tessa for introducing me to such a talented band, and I’m excited to see what more PENTAGON has in store for the future.

        Oh, and Tess, if you find yourself reading this, just know that you have secured the aux for life.
